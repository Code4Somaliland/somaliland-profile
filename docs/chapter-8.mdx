The Republic of Somaliland has undertaken major steps to attract both national and international investors
in the fecund productive sector of the country. The reforms and regulatory frameworks developed aim to
boost investor confidence in almost all sectors as has been set out in the Investor Guide.

The Government of Somaliland articulates why investors must have every confidence to step forward, citing
six reasons : 1) dependable security and democracy practices; 2) abundance of natural resources such as
deposits of oil, gas and coal, minerals and gemstones, energy, etc.; 3) conducive business environment for
both national and international investors. Many foreign direct investments have already taken roots such as
Coca Cola and DP World; 4) robust and state-of-the-art telecommunications sector which also offers grounds
for further investments and improvement; 5) livestock, Agriculture and fisheries offer unlimited potential for
investors, and 6) sound regulatory reforms which create an investment climate. Important legislation such as
‘the Foreign Investment Law, the Islamic Banking Law, the Central Banking Law, the Electrical Energy Act, and
the Commercial Banking Act—has either been passed or is making its way through parliament’.

Based on the Somaliland Five-year Development Plan there are six sectors in the economy that are regarded
as priority sectors, and the government is seeking to encourage foreign investment in those sectors: banking
and finance, livestock, agriculture, fisheries, industry and energy, tourism, telecommunication, ICT, roads, and
much more.

The most significant foreign direct investment (FDI) which the Republic of Somaliland has landed, in recent
years, is the Berbera port deal with the Dubai-owned international ports manager DP World. The Republic
of Somaliland entered into an agreement with the Dubai-based ports operator worth US$442 million in
exchange for a 30-year concession. Early on during this period, DP World will: (a) operate the Red Sea port;
(b) extend and build an additional quay; (c) build a free zone close to the port with the objective to turn
Berbera into a trade hub linking inland Africa to the outer world; and (d) to build a 250-kilometer dualcarriageway
connecting the Red Sea port to the trading town of Wajaale straddling the Somaliland-Ethiopia
border.
