## Somaliland History

### Archeological Evidence

Archeologists have discovered through
meticulous and painstaking attention to
detail that many of the ill-attended, yet-toexploited
landscapes of Somaliland were, in
fact, part of a region inhabited by the earliest
modern humans, hundreds of thousands of
years ago inhabited by the earliest-known
pastoralists of northeast Africa as the
spectacular rock art of this region indicates
dating back to 5000 to 12 000 years.17

The paintings, the ancient towns ruin, and
other traces marking the existence of past
civilizations in the area still hold volumes of
secrets that need to be unveiled.

Dr Sada Mire in a 2015 paper on Mapping
the Archeology of Somaliland gives us a
more detailed account of how important
this part of the world has been to the world
for eons past, stating that ‘the importance
of this region is largely due to its location
at the heart of ancient long-distance trade networks, making it a cultural crossroads.’

<em>
  The coastal populations were active seafarers, facilitating not only
  transmission of goods (gold, ivory, slaves, aromatic oils, animal skins, and
  textiles from Africa, in return for silk, glass objects, spices and Chinese
  porcelains, etc.) but also ideas and cultures (The Archaeology of the Islamic
  Empires of the Horn of Africa: Ruined Towns (ca. Sixth–Seventeenth Century
  CE)). Maritime archaeology is on its way but terrestrial coastal material
  shows that the people of this region were part of the Silk Road trade. The
  archaeological evidence from the Somali region shows material from Tang
  Dynasty to Ming Dynasty China. All these networks, trade and institutions
  culminated in the Islamic Medieval empires of the Horn of Africa, such as the
  Ifat and Awdal(Adal) states (The Archaeology of the Islamic Empires of the
  Horn of Africa: Ruined Towns (ca. Sixth–Seventeenth Century CE)). The above
  claims are all indicated by the body of past and recent archaeological
  discoveries in Somaliland (and Somalia) that account for more than 200 sites,
  many of them clusters of sites. Hopefully, proper study of these sites will
  substantiate and show the significance of this region for world prehistory and
  history. 18

### Somaliland Before 1884

The immediate region in which the Republic of Somaliland lies has been described as the ‘heart of ancient
long-distance trade networks, making it a cultural crossroads’. 20 According to linguists, the first Afro-asiaticspeaking
populations arrived during the ensuing Neolithic period from the family’s proposed urheimat
(“original homeland”) in the Nile Valley, or the Near East.

Written circa 50 to 68 B.C. by a Greek writer or writers, the Periplus of the Eryhthraean in hthraean Sea,
details a voyage that starts details a voyage that passes through some parts of present-day Somaliland on
its way to the Indian subcontinent. Notably, among the flourishing, coastal trading posts the writers stopped
to take note of were Avalites (Zeila), Malao (Berbera) and Mundus (Heiss). The description is unmistakable
but, as is in the case of Heiss (a.k.a.Xiis or Hiis), location of proper town may have shifted several hundred
yards to the east. Traces of the ancient town still show atop the promontory opposite the Ma’ajaleenka islet.

### Somaliland” The True Land of Punt

The fabled land of Punt that Egyptians so revered
could by all calculations be the present-day Republic
of Somaliland. Looking at the map of trade routes from
Egypt to Punt via rivers, wadis, and by sea and the charted
route of Queen Hatshepsut’s route during an expedition
to the Land of Punt on the Red Sea coast in 1493 BCE in
the 18th Dynasty of Egypt, there is no doubt the case is
so.

Geographically, Somaliland is nearer to Egypt than
Somalia, and as the items which the expedition found in
the land of Punt is also abundantly available in Somaliland
(gold, frankincense, myrrh, feathers, wildlife, etc.), logic
dictates that the expedition needed not to travel any
further for the same items and bypass Somaliland.

The Land of Punt was long associated with the goods
in ancient Egyptian markets because materials from
Punt were also used in their temple rituals. Priests wore
leopard skins, gold became statuary, and incense was
burned in the temples. Hatshepsut’s inscriptions also
claim that her divine mother was from Punt - and there is
evidence that Bes (the goddess of childbirth) came from
Punt Land as well.

Punt Land became a semi-mythical land for the
pharaohs, but it was a real place through the New
Kingdom (1570-1069 BC). During the reign of
Amunhotep II (1425-1400 BC) delegations from
Punt were accepted. The reign of Ramesses II
(1279-1213 BC) and of Ramesses III (1186-1155
BC) mentioned Punt as well. The pharaohs were
fascinated by Punt as a “land of plenty” and it was
best known as Ta Netjer – “God’s Land.

## Political History

### The British Protectorate

Somaliland, due to its strategic location near Bab
el Mandeb, at the entrance to Gulf of Aden and the
Red Sea, has always been of interest for strategic
and commercial reasons. In the mid-16th century,
the great Ottoman Empire annexed the port of
Zeila and provided protection, at a cost collected
through customs and other charges, for Arab,
Persian and Indian merchants who serviced the
trade requirements of the surrounding area and
the Abyssinian hinterland.

In 1870 the ambitious Khedive Ismael I of Egypt, whose country was
nominally part of the Ottoman Empire, obtained
the Ottoman Sultan’s authorized rights over Zeila in
exchange for paying an annual fee of sterling pounds
18,000. 23 The Khedive in due time acquired the coast
between Bulhar and Berbera without reference to the
Sultan.

In 1877 Britain signed a convention recognizing the
Khedival annexation of all the East African coast
north of Ras Hafun (the promontory of land jutting
out into the Indian Ocean south of Cape Gardafui).
The agreement stipulated that no portion of this area
should be ceded to any foreign power and that British
consular agents should be appointed at places on the
coast. The Sultan of Turkey, hitherto not very interested
in any land east of Zeila, generating, however, a piqued
interest of the Ottoman Empire.

As Egypt had opened the Suez Canal in 1869, Egyptian
interest shifted more on the coastline rather than
the interior. At coastal locations lighthouses, harbors,
piers, blockhouses, and barracks were constructed,
and running water supplies engineered. Some of these
facilities have lasted until recently.

In 1884 Egypt was facing the Mahdist revolt in the
Sudan and for financial reasons (dictated by Britain)
had to curtail its projects along the Somaliland coast.
By agreement with Britain the Egyptian flag remained
flying in Somaliland but Egyptian troops and officials
were withdrawn and replaced by very few British
troops, ships and officials from Aden.

### Britain Sets Protectorate

Shortly after Britain set garrisons in Aden, only 150
miles across the Berbera port of the Republic of
Somaliland, in 1839, Somaliland became a source of
fresh meat. With the departure of the Egyptians and the

possibility that other colonial powers had their
eyes trained on the potentials of the Somaliland
coasts and its hinterland, Britain had to act fast.
The British colonial office expedited Major A.
Hunt of Great, representing his government,
to draw up protection treaties with several
Somaliland clans.

Britain wooed Somaliland
clan leaders with a promise of protection,
guaranteeing them full support in case of an
attack from other neighboring territories, which
were then occupied by other Europeans (See
The Map of Africa by Treaty written by Sir E.
Hertslet). On their part, the clan elders of the
day refused to grant the British the right to land
unless they agreed to their terms.

The British agreed to the Somaliland conditions
among which were: (a) that Somaliland was to
be a Protectorate and not a colonial conquest,
and (b) that no British baby was to be delivered
on the mainland. Only after the agreement was
finalized and signed on hide skin aboard a ship,
was the British able to land. Soon after, Great
Britain sent its Vice Consuls to the Somaliland
coastal towns such as Berbera, Bulahar, and
Zeila. Due to the relative stability brought on
by the treaties, trading at coastal towns also
briskly picked up.

Somaliland became British
Protectorate/Colony in East Africa which not
only balanced its books but had also constantly
reported surpluses. The key to Somaliland’s
opulence by African economic standards of the
day was international trade, as the people in
the territory were in the words of one British
colonial officer, “Natural born traders.”
(See “Somaliland” by Andrew Hamilton)

<br />
<br />
Sayyed Mohammed Abdulla Hassan was an articulate, tall, thin, dark-skinned man
with a small beard and dark eyes who had an uncanny knack with word play and
poetry.

<br />
<img src="img/sayidka.PNG" alt="Sayyed Mohammed Abdulla Hassan" />

_A Mural of Sayyed Mohammed Abdulle Hassan painted to his likeness_

Sayyed Mohammed is reported to have been born in 1856, which, in Somali lore, was called Gobaysane – a
rich, prosperous year. The Sayyed studied under local religious scholars and perfected the holy book Quran,
Sunna and other religious studies in no time. He undertook the Hajj and studied under Mohammed Salih in
Mecca in the early 1890s – a name his sect so devoutly clung to until the end - Salihia.

Sayyed Mohammed Abdullah Hassan was to his
adherents a messianic Sunni, freedom fighter. At the
time he started the Dervish movement, he was seen
as a liberator, a man not interested in this world, and
a freedom fighter whose only objective was to drive
the ‘colonials’ out from the world of Somalis – the
British Protectorate. To a vast majority of Somalis and
foreigners, especially, the British, Italians and the
Ethiopians, he was the “Mad Mullah,” a quasi-religious
bandit leader intent on plunder and disruption who
imposed his will through savage executions and
mutilations.

The Sayyed waged an active campaign against the
British and clans that he labeled as loyalists to the
Crown started as early 1899. It was reported that
during this year he had amassed some 5000 men,
1500 of whom were mounted, under his command.

> “I have no forts, no houses, no country. I have
> no cultivated fields, no silver or gold for you to
> take — all you can get from me is war, nothing
> else. I have met your men in battle and have killed
> them. We are greatly pleased about this. Our men
> who have fallen in battle have won paradise…”,

he stated in a letter he dispatched to the British
Governor on the same year.

The British used superior firepower and masses of
troops against the Sayyed and, at each confrontation,
the British would proclaim victory. The fact remained,
though, that the Sayyed always evaded capture
rendering British claims meaningless. A sort of
truce which lasted until 1908 followed. But, again,
in 1912, 1913 and 1914, trouble between the two
sides resumed albeit at a much lower military-level
engagement. On the outbreak of World War I, the
British moved considerable numbers of their forces

to other theatres. Taking advantage of the situation,
the Sayyed consolidated his power base. He started
building stone forts atop strategic vantage points
which strategically commanded large areas atop
hills and mountains in the Sanaag and Sool areas,
which, due to the intensity of his war with European,
Ethiopian and Somali forces, he was not able to do
until then.

During this period, the Sayyed brought more than
half of the Protectorate territory under his direct
command or influence. The Sayyed, it has been
reported, received aid from the Ottomans, Germans
and, for a time, from the Emperor Iyasu V of Ethiopia.

By 1919 the Mullah’s hold on Somaliland had
become so strong that the British were faced either
with abandoning their protectorate or with using
a military force estimated at two infantry divisions
to deal with the bandit leader. In the bleak postwar
economic climate, this was an unaffordable option
for the British War Office.

On June 2, 1919, PM Churchill accepted a proposal
put to him by RAF Chief of the Air Staff, Sir Hugh
Trenchard, for a RAF airstrike against the Sayyed, his
forts and followers. A self-contained air component
comprising of 10 two-seat de Havilland D.H.9
reconnaissance-bombers, with 36 officers and 183
airmen, was approved.

The RAF built a makeshift base
at which was completed on 21 January 1920. Three
days later, six RAF D.H.9s took off from the DurElan
airfield to initial the first airstrikes on this part of
Africa on Sayyed Muhammed’s forts at Medeshi
and Jideli, east of Erigavo. The bombing and aerial
strafing continued hitting key forts and regrouping
grounds until the Sayyed fled to Taleh.

_stone forts atop of dervishes headquarter_

In early February, after aerial reconnaissance indicated
that his forces had reached Taleh, three D.H.9s
bombed the fort, one scoring a direct hit on the Mullah’s
compound. The Mullah fled the area defeated,
and his forces in disarray, crossing over to Ethiopia. 30
In November 1920, the Dervish movement he started
as an independence struggle 21 years ago ended
with his death in Imey, Ethiopia.

In the period between 1940 and 1941, the country
fell briefly under Italian occupation which helped
Somaliland parties to gain an insight into what was
developing in South Somalia Perhaps, it was this colonial
jolt, awakening which further propagating the
need for a greater Somali unity since the relationship
between the British and Somalis was more on equal
terms than the colonial nature of Italy’s outlook on
territories it occupied in east Africa.

## Contemporary History: Build-up to Independence 1935 – 1960

### Political parties

The first political party, the Somali National Society
(SNS), was founded in 1935. It later transitioned in
part to the Somali National League (1945) – perhaps
in alignment with its counterpart in Italian
Somalia – the Somali Youth League with whom it
shared many principles without necessarily actively
cultivating them. Mohamed Haji Ibrahim Egal, who
was to become later the first Prime Minister of Somaliland
led the (SNL). The National United Front
(NUF) led by Michael Mariano Ali, the United Somali
Party (USP), led by Ali Garad Jama, and many more
followed suit between 1945 and 1958.

In the period between 1940 and 1941, the country
fell briefly under Italian occupation which helped
Somaliland parties to gain an insight into what was
developing in South Somalia Perhaps, it was this colonial
jolt, awakening which further propagating the
need for a greater Somali unity since the relationship
between the British and Somalis was more on equal
terms than the colonial nature of Italy’s outlook on
territories it occupied in east Africa.

In 1943, Her Majesty the Queen of England and
Wales, it is reported, offered Somaliland leaders to
bring Somali-speaking areas like Hawd and Reserve
Area (5th Region of Ethiopia) and NFD (Northern
Frontier Districts) under Somaliland administration.
The overzealous elements among the yet-to-beseasoned
leaders saw it as a hoax to compartmentalize
the idea of a Greater Somalia. Hence, they turned
it down – a misjudgment that was to regrettably dog
Somaliland politics at every turn of its history.

Spontaneous insurrections demanding for an early
departure of all foreign occupations later surfaced
one of which was led by Sheikh Bashir Haji Yussuf
who was later in 1945 tried and hanged by the Brit-ish in Burao. The decade that led to 1960, however, was, for Somaliland politicians, time enough to fully prepare
themselves and their nation for full, diplomatically mature, politically and economically capable statehood. ‘At
the time of independence there was a strong anti-colonial sentiment sweeping the African continent. Somaliland
was no exception. There was a popular drive to unite all the five Somali inhabited territories including
Somaliland, Somalia, French Somaliland (Djibouti), Ogaden (Ethiopia), and the Northern Frontier District (NFD)
of Kenya. The five pointed white star on the flag symbolized this aspiration.

The 1954 Anglo-Ethiopian Agreement in which Britain transferred 25,000 sq. miles (64,750 sq. km) of ‘Hawd’ grazing land to Ethiopia evoked
an outcry in Somaliland and intensified the demand for a union to recover lost territory ‘ 32 At the time of
independence, there was a strong anti-colonial sentiment sweeping the African continent. Somaliland was no
exception. Eventually, `Somaliland had obtained its independence from Great Britain on June 26th, 1960`, by the
Royal Proclamation of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth. The independent state of Somaliland was the 15th state
to gain independence in Africa and was immediately welcomed by 35 UN member states included permanent
members of the Security Council. A few days later, Somaliland voluntarily entered into a merger with Italian
Somalia in July 1st 1960 to form the Somali Republic.

### Referendum on ‘Constitution of Somali Republic’

In June 1961, an openly rigged, quasi-referendum was conducted in areas in both the former British
Protectorate and Italian Somalia to decide whether the two sides would stay together or Apart. The move
was meant to quell once and for all the widespread displeasure of northerners of Somaliland to the unequal,
south-dominated partnership. Somaliland voted 52% against a constitution of the Somali Republic in 1961,
this was a clear sign that the merger between Somaliland and Somalia aborted and failed at the onset.

### Coup attempt of Somaliland Military Officials

In December 1961 – Disaffected Somaliland-born officers attempted a coup de tat to restore
Somaliland to its June 26, 1960, independent political status. The coup failed. The attempt was a
reflection of the dissatisfaction of the people of Somaliland who correctly predicted the outcome
of a merger which began with total domination of the Southern former Italian Somalia against the
north Somaliland.

The attempt was, also, an apt interpretation of feelings across the regions of Somaliland as, immediately
following the Somaliland politicians’ blunder, all leading positions, among which were the presidency,
the prime minister, House Speaker, Chief Justice and the commanders of all of the army, navy, police
and custodial corps all went to southern-born politicians and commanders. The usurpation of power
and the total abnegation of any vestiges of a ‘union’ were, largely, made a foregone conclusion by the
3:1 ratio balance of the parliament and the government in favor of the south.

### Military Coup

On October 21, 1969, a military junta led by Brigadier-General Mohamed Siyad Barre took over the regions of
the country. He took advantage of a vacuum created by the assassination of the then President Abdirashid Ali
Sharma’arke in Las Anod on 15 October 1969. He immediately jailed Mohamed Haji Ibrahim Egal, who at long
last became a Prime Minister in 1967 following the election of Sharma’arke to the Presidency, under arrest. And
so were the whole civilian government were arrested.

The ‘Revolutionary Council’ immediately declared that all political treaties which the civilian governments it
took over entered were null and void, thus throwing the last vestiges what was, in essence, a Somalia-dictated
‘merger’ into the wind. To consolidate his authority, the military dictator, SiyadBarre, started a surreptitious plan
to build a power base that was ultra-loyal to him and only him. Unbeknown to his comrades within the Council,
he began empowering individuals, clans and groups on whom he could rely to consolidate his power base.

One of his first targets was to turn the northern regions – the old Somaliland protectorate – into a military
chiefdom governed by hand-picked military governors. It was during the invasion he made on Ethiopia in 1977,
on the pretext that he was liberating ‘Western Somalis’, that the military strongman’s plans slowly unfolded
becoming visible to the discerning in the form of arbitrary executions of young, brilliant military officers, shooting
others on the back, and largely, replacing whole commands to install his hand-picked officers over them. At the
end of that short-lived war, Siyad Barre turned his wrath on civilians especially focusing on regions he marked
as potential threats to his one-man rule. Somaliland never dimmed in his view as the head of the list.

### The Somali National Movement **SNM**

<br />
<img src="img/snm.PNG" alt="The Somali National Movement " />

One writer puts the emergence of the Somali National Movement (SNM) and its rise to a force to be reckoned
with to a reaction to ‘General Barre’s continued atrocities, summary executions, target assassinations, arbitrary
arrests, expulsions, freezing commercial activities and, above all, mass starvation of millions of nomads whose
livestock and water points had been destroyed by the army forces as part of the eradication campaign’.

Mark Bradbury, states that intellectuals, businessmen and religious leaders founded the SNM as a result of
‘Isaaq disaffection with the regime’ arising ‘from a number of sources: inadequate (and undemocratic) political

representation, unequal distribution of development
resources, and government regulation of business,
particularly the livestock and qaat trade’ . 34 The
ten years between 1981 and 1990 and the events
that transpired laid the foundation for the inception
and establishment of a restored sovereignty in
Somaliland.

A great number of reasons are cited for
the rise against the military dictatorship of General
Mohamed Siyad Barre. Among these was widespread
oppression targeting a major section of the people
then living in what was known as the northern
regions of ‘Somalia’ – namely the Northwest,
Togdheer, Sool and Sanaag regions. A widely
reported marginalization, under-development,
political, social and economic repression, uneven
spread of resources, lopsided power-sharing, capital
punishment became the order of the day.

In 1981, the pent up frustration within the
Isaaq community was explosively triggered by
the government’s arrest of a group of Hargeisa
intellectuals, 10 whose only crime was to have
organized self-help programs. Accused of distributing
anti-government propaganda and other subversive
activities, they were handed down sentences ranging
from death (later commuted to life imprisonment)
to long-term prison sentences. Their detention and
torture helped to mobilize national and international
condemnation of the regime.

At roughly the same time, consultations within the
Isaaq, both within Somalia and in the Diaspora
communities of the Gulf, Saudi Arabia, and the
United Kingdom, led to the formation in London,
of the rebel Somali National Movement (SNM). By
1982, the SNM had established bases in Ethiopia,
from where it waged an armed struggle against
the regime’s forces in the north, initially in the form
of clandestine cross-border incursions.

In January
1983, the SNM campaign gathered momentum with
a daring raid on Mandheera Central Prison, which
released over 1,000 political detainees and other
inmates who had been condemned to death (GOS -
Background: 1994).

In return, the government redoubled its campaign
of brutal repression. In the urban centers, arbitrary
arrests, detentions and executions accelerated. In
the rural areas, the regime sought to undermine the
SNM’s support among nomads by destroying their
livelihoods. Water points were declared off limits,
closed, destroyed, poisoned and mined. Commercial
trucks were grounded, starving the rural community of
food, medicines, and other consumer goods. Villages
were razed to the ground and soldiers allowed to
confiscate livestock without compensation.35
In the years starting from the inception of the SNM,
responding to the socially and politically repressive
campaign of the regime against central clans in
Somaliland, military commanders were appointed as
governors to the then regions of Togdheer, Northwest
and Sanaag, and were given free hand to deal with
the emerging situation as they saw fit.

Arbitrary arrests, spur-of-the-moment detentions,
property impoundment, creation of civilian militias,
transfer of large populations from neighboring
Ethiopia to take over coastal and agricultural lands
and the open segregation of resident clans linked to
the SNM became openly and unabashedly the order
of the day. It reached a stage where even a private
army man transferred to these regions became rich
within no time living off the proceeds of bribes,
protection money and loots he earned off petrified
members of the central clan which formed the bulk
of the Movement’s power base.

Ultimately SNM succeeded in liberating Somaliland and defeated the military regime of Siyad Barre in January 1991. The victory of SNM has become the beginning of reinstating the hope and the will of the people to
freely determine their political destiny and deepening the fate of peace and political solidarity of the people of
Somaliland. The aftermath of the victory of SNM, the SNM controlled that any retaliation should not happen and
this has paved the way for the Somaliland tribes and SNM leadership to hold a series political reconciliations and
peace building initiatives before the reassertion of the sovereignty.

### Extrajudicial Killings

The government, in attempt to isolate the central clans, wooed other non-Isaaq Somaliland clans into its fold,
thus training its whole attention and suppressive tactics against the Isaaqs. It was during the period between
1984 and 1988 that wanton killing in groups or by individuals became the norm of the day – sometimes with
flimsy pretexts, sometimes not. The cities of Hargeisa, Burao and Sanaag witnessed mass killings in the name of
the law.

Between 1987 and 1989, the regime of Somali dictator Siyad Barre massacred an estimated 200,000 members
of the Isaaq tribe, the largest clan group in the northwest part of Somalia. At the time, some Isaaqs were fighting
for independence, and to eliminate the threat, Barre tried to exterminate all of them. Experts now say there are
more than 200 mass graves in Somaliland, most of them in the Valley of Death.

In the mid-90s, the Somaliland War Crimes Investigations Commission to document the atrocities, and
help experts find mass graves dotted around the country. Shortly afterwards, the Peruvian Team of Forensic
Anthropology - Equipo Peruano de Antropologia Forense(EPAF) – started making yearly trips to Somaliland to
help the government properly document mass grave. Experts would uncover the mangled skeletons of dozens of
victims, some times more than two or three score lumped into one grave, some still tied together.

What was to be discovered defies the imagination. Al Jazeera and Professor Bulhan, between them, tell parts of
the story in videos of the same title ‘‘Kill All but the Crows.’’

A 2001 UN report investigating the attacks against the Isaaqs concluded that “the crime of genocide was
conceived, planned and perpetrated by the Somalia Government against the Isaaq people of northern Somalia.”
But the events have been mostly forgotten; the boys playing soccer did not know the story behind the bones.

### Landmines

The use of land-mines by government forces against civilians was especially damaging in this particular
region due to the majority of Isaaqs (and other northern Somalis) being pastoral nomads, reliant on the
grazing of sheep, goats, and camels. A report commissioned by the Vietnam Veterans of America Foundation
describes the ramifications of this tactic as follows:40 Such massive mining was part of the destructive and
inhumane policies of the Siyad Barre regime impacting on the socio-economy, infrastructure and livelihoods
of the people of Somaliland.
