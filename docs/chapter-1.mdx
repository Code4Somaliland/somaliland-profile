## Chapter 1 - Goverment

The government of Somaliland comprises legislative, executive, and judicial branches – each
of which counterchecks the other but does not have a direct overarching jurisdiction over the
other paving the way for a system of check-and-balance.

The legislative comprises a bicameral
parliament breaking into the house of elders, ‘Guurti’ or (Upper House of Parliament) and the Lower
House which is called the House of Representatives. Each of the two houses has 82 members.

The Guurti was born with the rebirth of the Republic and the restoration of its lost sovereignty in 1991 as an
extension of the Elders’ Council that adjudicated social and judicial matters during the emancipation years in
Ethiopia in the mid and late-80s.

The first elected members of the House of Representatives took their oath
in 2005 following a one-person, one-vote election which decided who was to represent the constituents.

The Executive Branch is headed by a President and a Vice President who are popularly elected on one of
three national political parties’ tickets.

His Excellency President Musa Bihi Abdi, elected in late 2017, presently
heads the state. H.E. Abdirahman Abdullahi Ismail ‘Zeili’i is the Vice President.

The current government is the
fifth in the 29-year history of the Republic and the third elected on the one-person, a one-vote democratic
system with each government handing over reins of government to the next, succeeding administration
peacefully and without rift or rancor.

### National Emblem

<p style={{ flex: 2 }}>
  The emblem, set off by a circular yellow background, consists of a
  coffeecolored falcon sitting below two scales and at the bottom of which are
  two hands clasped in a handshake. Starting from an intertwined knot at the
  bottom two, open-ended laurels branch off upwards on either side of the scales
  and the falcon. The Bismillah in Arabic closes the gap at the top of the
  laurels and the words Allahu Akbar (Allah is Great) are inscribed on the chest
  of the falcon.

### National Anthem

The Republic of Somaliland National anthem - ‘ Samo ku waar’ (Live in Eternal
Peace) 1 - was composed by the late great playwright and songwriter, Hassan
Sheikh Mumin.

### Constitution

The Constitution of the Republic of Somaliland was adopted by the House of Representatives on 30 April 2000.
It replaced a National Charter that has served as the principal guiding document since it was passed in 1993 at
the Borama conference. Subsequently, the political system of Somaliland has had this transition from clans elected
representatives to popular elections. And it was the historic year of 2001, when the national referendum was held, in
which 97.% of voters, who turned out in large numbers, not only ratified the national constitution but also reaffirmed
the decision for Somaliland to reinstate its sovereign nation-state.

### Judicial system

The National Constitution defines the country’s judicial system as: ‘‘The state [180] shall have a judicial
branch whose function is to adjudicate on proceedings between the Government and the public and
between the various members of the public (Article 97 (1), which also establishes the Supreme Court,
Appellate courts of the regions, regional courts, district courts and the courts of the national armed forces.

### Political Parties

The Republic of Somaliland’s Constitution permits three national political parties which are currently
`Kulmiye` (ruling party), `UCID` and `WADDANI` – the two opposition parties.
