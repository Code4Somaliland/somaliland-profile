# Economoy

## Somaliland Economy

### Growth rate: 3.5%

Taking 2012 as a starting point, the country’s
budget had been on the rise indicating a healthy,
overall growth despite the severe drought in
2015 and the livestock export ban later in 2017.

### GDP (Gross Domestic Product)

2,573 million US dollars (2017 EST.)

### GDP - per capita

675 US Dollars.

### Agriculture

In Somaliland farming contributes between 8%
and 15% of the GDP, as livestock production and
exports are the backbone of the economy and the
biggest hard currency earner for the country. Due
to the importance of livestock, the Somaliland
Government treats it as a different sector and has
a separate ministry dedicated to livestock.

<LazyLoad

<br />
<br />

It is estimated that about 10% of the land is
suitable for agriculture. Despite being erratic and
often scanty there are nevertheless two main rainy
seasons. These are GU or spring (April to June) and
Deyr or autumn (September to October), in between
these two rainy seasons there is also Karan (late
July through September) most occur in the western
regions.

The farming in Somaliland is predominantly
subsistence in nature. The principal grain crop
grown under rain fed conditions is sorghum,
followed by maize; and both crops are grown
primarily for household consumption by smallscale
farmers. Fruit and vegetable crops, which are
relatively small, are grown mainly for commercial
purposes and the principal commercial crops are
tomatoes, lettuce, onions, watermelon, peppers,
cabbages, oranges, lemons, and papaya.

Rain-fed farming accounts for 90% of the total
area cultivated, while the area under irrigation
constitutes only 10%, supporting about 4,000 farm
families. The sector is dominated by smallholder

farmers who own farms ranging from 2 to 30
hectares in the area. The average farm size is
approximately 4 hectares. During the dry season,
irrigated farms make good profits, because the
supply in the vegetable and fruit markets is low
in this period. The shortfalls are usually filled
by imports from neighboring countries such as
Ethiopia and Somalia. In recent years, the cultivation
of watermelon has emerged as an important source
of income for the farmers. Presently, watermelon is
the only fruit crop that is exported successfully to
Djibouti.

### Livestock

Livestock is currently the leading economic sector
in all of Somaliland. Livestock production accounts
for 60-65% of the gross domestic product (GDP).

<LazyLoad src="/img/livestock.jpg" alt="Somaliland livestock export" />

<br />
<br />

Based on 1998 FAO estimates of livestock numbers
and past growth rates, Somaliland has about 1.69
million camels, 0.40 million head of cattle, 8.4
million goats and 8.75 million sheep in 2011.
The Sool, Sanaag and Togdheer regions account
for about 75% of all livestock. Somaliland’s major
livestock exports are sheep and goats, accounting
for 91% of all animal exports. In 2010 a total of
2.352 million shoats were exported through the
Berbera port (including from Ethiopian sources).
Of this total, 1.612 million (69%) were exported
between September and November for the Hajj
festivities.

Assuming an average export price of
US$70, the estimated total value would be
over US$160 million. With government taxes
at around US$3.60 per head, this means tax
revenue of around US$8.5 million or 10% of the
Somaliland government’s total revenue.

Somaliland, and to a certain extent the other
exporters from the Horn of Africa, depends on
only a few countries for exports. For example,
out of the 2.585 million head of sheep and goat
exported through the Port of Berbera in 2010,
about 78% went to Saudi Arabia, 20% to Yemen
and the rest to Egypt and Oman. With increased
investment, smart regulation, infrastructure
development, sector coordination, and improved
branding, Somaliland has ample opportunities to
capitalize on the growth of the livestock sector in
the Middle East and other regions of the world,
while supporting the growing local demand.

### Livestock Population

There were above 20 million heads of livestock
in Somaliland in the year 2013. Of course, since
then, there happened a severe drought that has
culled stocks, especially, cattle, camels and sheep
down to a less level. Much head found salvage
along the Golis. Mountains which retains much
of its foliage throughout the year. Livestock
populations in the West of Somaliland did not
also suffer as much in the 2015 protracted
drought which ran offer to early 2016. Other
livestock had also been trucked to remote areas
in Somalia where it found succor.

### Poultry Farms

There are 12 successful poultry farms in the
country which are small scale farms that hold
between 300- 60,000 heads of chickens and are
mostly layers (egg-layers) based in the peri-urban
farms.

The poultry industry is new and poultry
production is an emerging source of food that if
encouraged and invested well can be viable. The
core challenges of poultry industry include feed
(feed cost is very high in Somaliland due to limited
agricultural by-products), limited experience of
farmers for poultry rearing and absence of local
agencies for the production of low-cost vaccines
to control endemic diseases of poultry. Poultry is
a good source of income for households, nutrition
for children and is manageable by the females if
well trained.

Mostly, the poultry breeds kept in Somaliland are
European breeds (hybrid) which prove difficult to
adapt the local weather and the existing endemic
diseases, the local breeds are characterized by low
production and productivity.

### Dairy Farms

There are increasing peri-urban dairy farms in
suburbs of cities which are a form of livestock
investment to turn livestock products into a
commercialized sector that is capable to maximize
returns from animal products. There are nine (9)
peri-urban dairy farms registered by the Ministry
of Livestock since 2011, these farms were
invested by traders in the urban centers which
are a success story when it comes to investments.
These Peri-urban farms include dairy and
fattening farms, there have been also 15 (15 milk
cooperatives and associations) milk cooperatives
and meat cooperatives who are aimed to bring

the stakeholders together in a coherent way that
provides the voice. The increasing farms do require
capacity –building, enabling environment, including
credit system, technical support and strengthen their
governing structure. There is a small industry that
processes milk (although its process powder milk
imported from abroad as bottled Yoghurt). These
farms and industries are not only investment but are
also demonstration form that is eye-opening for the
other traders. There is, therefore, an important space
for the government to institutionalize them and create
continual awareness programs to encourage more
investment.

### Contribution to Food Security

Livestock plays a very crucial role in the food security
of the people that inhabit the Somali ecosystems. Meat
and milk are the two animal food sources which people
of Somaliland depend on; it is obvious that milk and
meat are very important staples in the Somaliland diet,
a major source of proteins, minerals as well as vitamins
for the rural population to whom vegetables are often
inaccessible. Rural households meet their demand for
carbohydrates through the sale of their livestock in
local markets investing the earnings to purchase rice,
maize, sorghum, tea, sugar and pasta amongst other
products.

Selling livestock to buy grain could be lucrative as long
as the “caloric terms of trade” are good for livestock
owners. This relates pastoral production to pastoral
consumption of cereals (both expressed in energy
values) through the price of the respective products
and their energy value on the market. However, to
profit from this exchange of protein for carbohydrates,
pastoralists rely on three things: trader willingness
to buy animals or milk when cash is needed for food,
trader willingness to sell low-cost cereals or grains
when pastoralists need them at places that are safely
accessible, and the ability to sell animals without
jeopardizing the national herd size, structure, and composition. This concept of “caloric terms of trade” helps
the understanding of what goes on in pastoral societies, and it evolves around the relative caloric value
between grain and livestock or milk.

## Fisheries

### Coastal Characteristics

The western coast has wide sandy beaches, while the eastern coast has relatively narrow sandy beaches
broken at intervals by rocky outcrops and cliffs. The continental shelf on the eastern coast is between 5 to
10kms wide when measured at the 200m depth line. The shelf becomes wider-reaching around 30-50kms
near Zeila town area at the border with Djibouti.

<LazyLoad src="/img/fishery.jpg" alt="Somaliland Fisheries" />

<br />
<br />

### Fish Resources

The average annual value of the potential fish catch is estimated at US$32 million, assuming a freight on
Board (FOB) price of US$2 per kilogram based on current practices and sales in Gulf markets as reported in a
variety of United Nations and World Bank reports (JNA, Productive Sectors Report, Sept, 2007). As per recent
estimates, the yearly sustainable catch available to Somaliland fishermen could be around 40,000 metric
tons (Shuraako. org).

### Current Fish Production

Somaliland is endowed with a rich coastline along the Gulf of Aden and Indian Ocean. These waters are
home to an extensive list of fish species, including various species of tuna, albacore, lobster, swordfish, shark,
and many others. Even though no comprehensive data is available, estimates from fragmented assessments
point to the existence of large untapped resources in a pristine environment (IUCN 1997/99 and Cesvi 2011).

The estimated catch by local Somaliland fishermen is around 15,000 – 20,000 metric tons annually.
However, it must be noted that fishing boats from neighboring countries like Yemen do still come and fish
illegally in Somaliland water. These actions are being taken seriously. The actual number of boats and the

quantity of fish they catch annually is difficult to determine; however, it is estimated that illegal fish reaches
4800mt – 6000mt yearly. Yemenis are known to utilize wooden or plastic boats of small sizes (8-11m in length)
with carrying capacities between 3mt and 7mt. They tend to be afraid of being arrested and stay far away from
Somaliland fishing water in the daytime.

<LazyLoad

/>

<br />
<br />

<LazyLoad
  src="/img/fishspecies.PNG"
  alt="Somaliland Fish Species"
  caption="Major Fish Species By Region"
/>
<br />

Somaliland’s potential for expansion can be illustrated by reviewing the status of fishing sectors of
nearby countries. Yemen, which shares the same sea with Somaliland has been producing 230,000,
180,000 and 174,800 metric tons in the years 2006, 2007 and 2008 respectively (World bank 2009).
In the Hadramout region of Yemen which is directly opposite to the Somaliland coast, the average
production of fish for the years 2003-2005 was 85,511mt. It’s therefore fair to assume that similar
production is feasible in Somaliland waters provided.

### Fishing Communities/Cooperatives

There are major settlements of fishing communities along the coast of Somaliland. Starting from the
west, they are Loyado, Tokoshi, Zeila, lughaya, Elsheik, Bulahar, Geri, Berbera, Elgerdi, Karin, Shal’o, Heiss,
Mait, Laskorey, Elayo.

## Extractives and Energy

<LazyLoad
  src="/img/ministryofenergy.jpg"
  alt="Somaliland Ministry of Energy and minerals"
  caption="Somaliland Ministry of Energy and Minerals"
/>
<br />

With the kind of the yet-to-be-tapped abundance
of gemstones, hydrocarbons and minerals
resources that the Republic of Somaliland is
endowed with, the time has come for the country
to invite international investors to partner with it
to explore potential and optimize production. The
resources need to be extracted to alleviate the
country from its economic recess which initiative
is already taking momentum at some quarters.
The efforts, however, are somewhat hampered by
the absence of intrepid international partners to
spearhead the country’s diplomatic recognition
without which no meaningful, multilateral
agreements can be reached.

Certainly, investors who take the first step of
acquiring minerals exploration licenses to
look for a commercial deposit of the mineral
of their choice or a mining license to exploit a
proven resource will be richly rewarded for their
efforts. However, a more detailed, geologicalgeochemical
exploration is needed to assess the
commercial mining potential of these occurrences, discoveries, and potential minable deposits. We
strongly urge international mining companies to invest
in Somaliland’s mineral sector. The government of
Somaliland will welcome such investors with conducive
and competitive mining terms.

### Energy

Currently, the principal sources of energy in Somaliland
are of two main origins: Imported petroleum and local
biomass resources. Petroleum is imported in the form of
refined diesel, petrol, and aviation gas, all of which are
used for transportation and electric power generation.

<LazyLoad src="/img/energy.jpg" alt="Somaliland Energy" />
<br />

Other imported petroleum products including
kerosene and natural gas which are used for cooking
by certain segments of the urban community.
Kerosene, in addition to cooking, is also used for
illumination by a large number of consumers.

Somaliland power producers now use imported
diesel fuel as the only source of energy to generate
electricity. It is estimated that collectively,
companies burn more than 90-100,000 liters of
diesel fuel every day in Somaliland. Independent
Power Producers (IPPs)4 also struggle with heavy
operational and maintenance costs of diesel
generators. The electricity tariff rate in Somaliland
is probably the highest in Africa at approximately
$1.00- 1.40 /kWh5. As global consumption, fuel
costs and unstable imported fuel supply problems
continue to rise, electricity costs will also rise.

This level of cost is already restricting business
development in Somaliland, and as it increases, at a
certain point it will be too expensive for the majority
of business and ordinary consumers in Somaliland.
For power producers, it is becoming difficult to
stay profitable and be sustainable. As a result, the
Government is prioritizing energy investment from
private and public sources and is confident that
major investment opportunities exist to upgrade,
diversify and modernize this important sector.

It has been estimated that the capital investment
required by Somaliland’s energy sector is US$15.17
million for 2012-2016, of which $5 million is
expected to come from the private sector (National
Development Plan 2012-2016). Key priority
challenges that investors, policy-makers, and donors
need to address in the sector include:

- The need to invest in the outdated power plants
  and limited power distribution network; T
- The need to diversify away from the dependence
  on imported fuel for power generation – which
  has resulted in higher electricity costs in Somaliland.
- The development of necessary skills and
  technical resources to utilize alternative energy
  sources for power production.
- The development, review, passage, enforcement,
  and wide dissemination of key pieces of energy
  legislation.
- The need to promote energy saving culture and
  invest in energy efficient technology.

Since the declaration of independence in 1991,
Somaliland’s electricity system was rebuilt and is
now operated almost entirely by independent power
producers each supplying areas in its neighborhood.
Some of these are “dedicated” IPPs who sell
electricity as a central part of their business model,
but many others need electricity generation for their
own business activities and sell excess electricity to
nearby customers to supplement their own income
and recoup costs. Both kinds of IPPs have fully
vertically-integrated systems; they have built and
maintained infrastructure to generate, transmit
and distribute electricity in the areas in which they
operate.

In Somaliland, each area’s electricity infrastructure
has been developed by the IPP working in that area.
Until now, grids have not been connected, and the
systems have not been unbundled, due to the high
fixed cost of building new infrastructure. In each
of those areas, almost all power distribution is via
diesel generators for which fuel is expensive and of
variable quality.

While over 20 IPPs operate in Somaliland, there
has been significant consolidation of IPPs in recent
years with many IPPs coming together to form one
large company in order to deal with duplication
and inefficiencies. This is a trend that is emerging
in Hargeisa, Somaliland’s capital, as well as other
cities. Larger players have used this opportunity to
pursue outside funding which is considerably more
difficult for smaller players.

There is a clear need for investment in the energy sector, to reduce costs and prices, and to keep up with
Somaliland’s rapid economic expansion.

### Hydrocarbons

When it comes to hydrocarbons, Somaliland is one of the few high potentials yet underexplored areas around
the globe. The existence of oil and gas in Somaliland was known since the beginning of the last century,
through oil seepages in several parts of the country confirming the working petroleum system. It is only the
finding of the big structures and the discovery of commercial accumulations that have so far eluded the limited
and intermitted exploration and the small number drilling over that length of time.

The petroleum system of Somaliland consists of high-quality source rocks of various ages, reservoir units
of both classticand carbonates as well as excellent sealing rocks. The trapping mechanism is dominated
by extensional tectonic structures of rotated fault blocks and related ductile deformations The geology of
Somaliland is very similar to that of Yemen as the two sides of the Gulf of Aden were only separated during
Miocene (around 30 million years).

Reconstruction of the Arabian Plate to the position before the opening of the Gulf of Aden shows that the
southern Yemen productive basins extend to Somaliland.
The stratigraphy of the two countries compares very well and Somaliland has numerous basins with the
potentiality of containing commercial hydrocarbons.

<LazyLoad
  src="/img/basin.jpeg"
  alt="Somaliland oil"
  caption="Extension of Yemen Basin to Somaliland"
/>
<br />

The petroleum exploration interest of the country started in 1912 when an oil seep at DhagahShabel, 38 km
south-east of Berbera, was reported. In 1959 Standard Vacuum (Mobil and Esso) drilled three wells (Dhagah
Shabel-1, -2, and -3) near the Dhagah Shabel oil seep, without the aid of subsurface control.

Two of the wells recovered a small amount of free oil (33.6 API) from the Wanderer limestone (Upper Jurassic) and Nubian
sandstone (Upper Cretaceous). This is believed to be sourced by the high-quality Upper Jurassic Dhaghani shale.
Interest in oil exploration recommenced in the late 1970s and, in 1980, GECO conducted an extensive offshore
speculative seismic survey in the Gulf of Aden for
the Somali government. In the same year Quintana
Oil Company and Hunt Oil Company conducted a
detail exploration programme which included an
aeromagnetic survey and a seismic programme over
onshore blocks 32 and 35.

From 1986 to 1990 Conoco Oil Company carried over
4000km of 2D seismic survey in area within their old
blocks which covered almost 98,700km2, in Nugal basin
of Sool and Togdheer regions of Somaliland. Based on
the data acquired, processed and interpreted Conoco
sanctioned the drilling of two wells; Nugaal-1 &Kelis

In March 2009, TGS-NOPEC Geophysical Company (TGS)
completed processing and interpretation of speculative
survey in Somaliland, acquired in partnership with the
Somaliland Ministry of Water and Mineral Resources
(currently named as The Ministry of Energy and
Minerals). The programs included 5,300km of marine
2D seismic and approximately 34,000km of highresolution
aeromagnetic data covering onshore areas.

### Multi-Client 2d Seismic Project

<LazyLoad
  src="/img/exploration.jpg"
  alt="Somaliland oil exploration"
  caption="The Ministry of Energy and Minerals formulated and
facilitated a multi-client 2D seismic project in which it"
/>
<br />

presented to all the international oil companies
which have production-sharing agreements with
the government. This was an effort by the ministry
to enable the IOC’s to fulfill their exploration
obligation on a slimmer budget than having to get
into separate contracts with seismic contractors.

BGP Inc. (a Chinese national seismic contractor
and the leading company in onshore seismic) won
the international tender held by the Ministry. The
first project of the multi-client arrangement was
concluded in January 2018, acquiring of 3,500km
of 2D.

The second project of the multi-client has been
concluded six months later, July 2018, acquiring
nearly 800km of 2D seismic for RAK Gas on
block SL9. The recent oil and gas activities and
indeed the other major international investment
in Somaliland is a fair reflection of the peace
and stability this country had for a long time. In
addition, it is at the most priority of the recently
elected government to increase production. It is
particularly giving a great deal of attention on
hydrocarbons and minerals.

This is not surprising since all most all the regional
countries have now made discoveries of oil and
gas and since the focus of the oil and gas sector is
currently on Eastern Africa The above-mentioned
priority is not only a government-driven campaign
but rather a national ambition embraced by the
whole community.

The success of recent exploration projects was
made possible by the support and effort of the
public particularly the local communities.With
regard to safety and security, it is a point of
noteworthy that during the two major seismic
projects, covering 5 regions there have not been
any major security incidents and on the safety
side, there has been a great achievement of 2
million man-hours without LTI.

The current scheme of Somaliland oil and gas
blocks consists of 24 blocks of both onshore and
offshore. Only a quarter of that is presently held by
IOC’s that have exploration and production sharing
agreement with the government. The block system is
one degree one block and therefore are huge in size
(each about 12,000km2). Many of these blocks have
a great deal of potentiality and open for investors.
Somaliland is elongated east-west along the Gulf of
Aden and hence all the blocks are not far from the
coast furthest being about 300km away.

### Minerals

Based on the geological and geochemical surveys and
studies that were conducted to date, the mineralized
zones of Somaliland are highly prospective to host a
wide range of minerals. Studies that were conducted
to date have recorded the occurrences of precious
metals, base metals, heavy minerals, non-metallic
minerals, and gemstones in many areas across the
regions of the Republic of Somaliland.

The occurrence of precious metals, including
platinum, silver, and gold, have been recorded in
several regions of Somaliland, and a gold prospect
area was discovered in the region of eastern Sanaag,
fueling increased artisanal activity in the area since
last year . Recorded occurrences and prospects for
base metals in the country include Zinc, lead, copper,
iron, titanium, manganese, beryllium, columbitetantalite,
chromium, molybdenum, tin, nickel,
vanadium, ilmenite and bismuth.55 Furthermore,
mineral sands deposits along with the coastal
areas of Somaliland, east and west of Berbera, have
the potential to contain commercially important
titaniferous heavy minerals that can be easily
mined. Heavy minerals accumulation in these sands
includes ilmenite, magnetite, rutile, monazite and
zircon. A recent study of these heavy mineral sands
has concluded that the development prospects of these
mineral sands are encouraging.

Somaliland is also endowed with significant deposits of
non-metallic industrial minerals such as gypsum, mica,
feldspar, kaolin, and sapiolite. Decorative stones such as
jade, which are currently mined, and quartz crystals are
additionally available. For instance, there is a world-class,
ready to be mined gypsum deposit of 96-99% purity
estimated at 180 million tons above ground and nearly
twice this quantity below the surface in an area near the
Port of Berbera. Gypsum is mainly used for construction
and also as an additive in the manufacture of cement.

If an investor is found to mine and set up a processing
plant there, it could easily be shipped on a massive
scale for export to other countries. The availability of
dimension stones such as granite, limestone, marble,
travertine, quartz-based stones are also widely available
in Somaliland.

### Gemstones

As an extension of the Mozambique belt which hosts many
types of gemstones in Kenya, Tanzania, and Madagascar,
Somaliland’s mineralized zones contain a variety of
gemstones that thus far have only been mined in a small
scale through artisanal activity. Gemstones occurrences
found in Somaliland include emerald, ruby, sapphire,
aquamarine, garnet, opal, amethyst, and topaz to name a
few.

<LazyLoad
  src="/img/gemstone.jpg"
  alt="Somaliland Gemstones"
  caption="Somaliland Gemstones"
/>
<br />

### Salt

Somaliland is blessed with abundant deposit of salt that has a potential for investment and export. Salt is
currently mass-produced by evaporation of seawater or brine from brine wells and salt lakes. Mining of rock salt
is also a major source; however, Somaliland is still far to reach its full potential of salt production. China is the
world’s main supplier of salt.

In 2010, world production was estimated at 270 million tons, the top five producers
(in million tons) being China (60.0), United States (45.0), India (20.0) Germany (16.5), and Canada (14.0).

### Coal

In the abstract to a scientific study paper he wrote on the International Journal of Oil, Gas and Coal Technology,
Dr. Mohamed Y Ali, asserted :

> Geological field mapping along with available geological and drilling data suggest that Somaliland has favorable
> stratigraphy and structure for coal deposits. Lignitic to sub-bituminous coal deposits with ages from Jurassic to
> Oligocene-Miocene occur in various locations across the country including Hed-Hed valley south of Onkhor, Guveneh
> hills north of Las Dureh and Daban Basin southeast of Berbera. However, the coal occurrence at Hed-Hed has

area in the years between 2006 and 2007, the following had been mapped:

- In the area of Gal Hamud ((45°09.885′ E; 10°09.713′ N)), eight kilometres north of Bihendula, coal stringers
  showing branches and trunks are deposited in the Lower Jurassic sandstones and conglomeratic beds of the
  Adigrat Formation which underlie the Bihen Limestone.

- Hed-Hed (46°14.484′ E; 10°33.802′ N) is located about 25 kilometres south of the coastal village of Onkhor.
  Coal deposits occur approximately 4 kilometres upstream in the Hed-Hed gorge from its junction with the
  Hodmo ravine. Hed-Hed has the greatest thickness and highest quality of coal so far exposed in the country but
  not ash free where Gal Hamud has the highest quality with low ash content and high calorific values.

## Tourism sites

The Republic of Somaliland has always been mapped as an area rich in both natural and prehistoric attractions
whose promise mesmerizes tourists and archeologists alike.

<br />

Even the best of tourist and travel agencies promoting the rich heritage of the country hardly make an indent
on the untold of, untapped, unspoiled, pristine locations that local communities accept as features blended into
the local lore, local terrain without realizing the added value they hold at the national and international fora as
cradles of civilization or as tourist attractions which can, potentially, account for much of the country’s foreign
currency earnings.

Somaliland tourist attractions at both the micro and macro-level contexts are much more than have been covered
by tourism agencies. Presently, the Gulf of Aden port of Berbera is one of the destinations most frequented
by tourists. The city does not only over one of the most pristine beaches in the region but, also, buildings and
sites that date back to times long past such as the Ottoman-Turk footprints in the area, Zeila, and its archipelago
of islands, is another seaside town which attests to the Ottoman Empire’s incursion into the area. Zeila is often
referred to as the entry point of Islam into Africa.

The scenic high vintage point views which Sheikh mountains, Daallo, Surud, Al Madow and the rest of
that part of the Golis Range mountains in the Sanaag region offer visitors are attractions that had held
the attention and imagination of tourists and tourism boards for a long time. The possibility of developing
the sites to a scale at par with Alps sites has often been discussed but not implemented to date. At
some points above the awesome escarpments, for instance, one finds himself looking down at majestic
clouds slowly moving, blending and separating hundreds of meters down.

## Telecommunications

At present, telecommunication in Somaliland has entered the fifth generation. It is one of the most thriving, best
developed industries in Somaliland. The government is in the process of effecting interconnectivity among the two
mobile gsm providers: Telesom and Somtel. Both companies also provide mobile banking and internet access, as
well as prepaid call plans, monthly subscription plans, international roaming, SMS, WAP (over both GSM and GPRS),
residential fixed-line services. Both companies are about to introduce 5G services on top of the enviably, highly
sophisticated platforms they are already running successfully.

Telesom was founded in 2001, Somtel in 2008 though
becoming fully operational in 2010. Somcable largely concentrates on the provision of fiber optic Internet services
and was founded in 2016.
