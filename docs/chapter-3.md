## Population

Overall population can be deduced from area specific computations made of population distribution in the different
regions of the Republic adding up to 5.7 million.11

### Population Growth rate

The latest UNFA / Somaliland Ministry of Health survey (MoHD/UNFPA 2020) 12 establishes that the population
of Somaliland is growing by 2.93% Other sources quote different figures: Population Data (3.14%), ranking it as
126th in world populations.

A 2018 study conducted by the International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI), however, chooses to differ by stating
that ‘Somaliland faces a high population growth estimated at 4.3% per annum’. This growth is much higher in urban
areas, where it reaches approximately 20% per year in Hargeisa (MoNP&D 2011) 13

### Population Density

Population estimates survey ( PESS) of 2014 estimates 22 persons per /km². However, PopulationData.net (March 2019) puts population density at 28.27 inhabitants / km².

### Death rate

A CIA Fact book (2017), which does not distinguish between Somaliland- and Somalia-specific demographics
estimates that there are 13.1 deaths to 1,000 persons of the population.

### Fertility Rate 14

- a) TFR in rural areas : 6.1 children per woman
- b) TFR in urban areas: 5.0 children per woman
- c) Average TFR in Somaliland : 5.5 children per woman

  The total fertility rate is highest among women from the poorest quintile, 6.7 children per woman. Women from the
  richest quintile have the lowest TFR, 4.3 children per women.

### Life expectancy

According to the Ministry of Health Development, life expectancy for males is 54 and 57 for females

### Literacy rate

Average literacy rate for adults above 15 years of age is estimated at 48.0%.15 Literacy rates were highest for the
youth aged 15-24 who had literacy rates of 74% for males and 55% for females. The literacy rate tends to decline as
age increases beyond 24 years. On aggregate, about 37% of males and 35% of females have completed secondary
education as their highest grade completed. Additionally, about 3 in 10 males and 2 in 10 females have a university
education. The largest share of the remaining proportion of persons has an upper primary or lower primary education.

### Language

Article 6 of the Constitution of the Republic of Somaliland defines the primary language of the country as ‘Somali’.
Arabic is adopted as a second language, adding that ‘other languages shall be used, when necessary’

### Religion

Islam is the official religion of the Somaliland Republic as Article 5 of the country’s constitution stipulates. Article 33
(1), however, grants both citizens and non-citizens the right to belief in the creed of their choice: ‘Every person
shall have the right to freedom of belief, and shall not be compelled to adopt another belief. Islamic
Sharia does not accept that a Muslim person can renounce his beliefs.’

### Net migration rate

These statistics were published by the UN International Organization for Migration (IOM). In line with the current UN
policy towards Somaliland, the statistics cited here for Somalia are also true for Somaliland. Net Migration rate
for 2015-2020: -3.4 migrants/1,000 population.

### Urbanization rate

Somaliland Ministry of Planning and Developments statistics department (CSD) puts urban and semi-urban, sedentary
populations at 53% of the total.
